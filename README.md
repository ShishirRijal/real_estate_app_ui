# realstate_app_ui
My new ui work in flutter...

## About
Tried creating a simple, yet beautiful real estate app ui using FLUTTER.. 
It uses the concepts of some very basic flutter widgets, including provider.
The use of provider was not necessary, yet I used it in this app, so that I could implement the concepts I learned.

The flutter code is completely written by me(ShishirRijal), however the ui concept was taken from Gurvinder Singh at dribbble.com
